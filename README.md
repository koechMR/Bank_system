## Bank_system
In this project i created a simple code for Bank managent system
The Bank Account Management system is a simple program written in C that allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can select various options.The program uses a struct BankAccount to represent a bank account, which consists of an account number and a balance. Users can create new accounts by providing an account number and an initial balance. They can deposit money into their account, withdraw funds (if the balance is sufficient), and check their current balance.
