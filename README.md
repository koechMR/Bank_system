In this project i created a simple code for Bank managent system
The Bank Account Management system is a simple program written in C that allows users to create bank accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can select various options.

The program uses a struct BankAccount to represent a bank account, which consists of an account number and a balance. Users can create new accounts by providing an account number and an initial balance. They can deposit money into their account, withdraw funds (if the balance is sufficient), and check their current balance.

The program utilizes functions such as createAccount, deposit, withdraw, and checkBalance to perform the corresponding operations on the bank account. It also includes a menu display function displayMenu to present the available options to the user.

The code demonstrates basic concepts of C programming, including the use of structures, user input, conditional statements, loops, and function calls. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and additional features and error handling can be incorporated to make the system more robust and practical for real-world scenarios.
